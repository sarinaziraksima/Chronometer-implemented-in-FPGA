# Chronometer-implemented-in-FPGA
Timing special events is an important aspect of todayâ€™s control systems. Therefore, building a chronometer with a clock speed of 50 MHz is significantly beneficial. In this project, we designed a chronometer connected to an external 4-digit seven-segment display for showing time in 0.1-second intervals. There is also a button that helps to shift the scale to 1 second.

This component can easily be connected to larger systems, providing time management for desired applications.
